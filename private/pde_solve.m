function [u0, U] = pde_solve(mod, opt, M, N)
% PDE_SOLVE solves the Black-Scholes PDE numerically on a bounded domain.
%
%   [u0, U] = PDE_SOLVE(mod, opt, M, N) returns u0 = u(0,S0), where u
%   solves the Black-Scholes partial differential equation with boundary
%   conditions u(t,L) = u(t,U) = 0 for 0 <= t < T and u(T,x) = h(x) for
%   L <= x <= U, and V the full numerical solution to this partial differential 
%   equation. V is calculated by using a finite differences scheme with [0,T] 
%   divided into N pieces and the domain [L,U] divided into M pieces. P is 
%   calculated by linear interpolation.
